# Obscurus.ghost 1.1


Just another POC logger using discord webhooks 
=

- Coded in python3
- Using requests to send data over to discord webhook
- Why would you even use this? 
- This is just a project for me to try and learn python
- Is just WIP, dont expect much

Future plans:
=
I might continue and update this repo once in a while.
But i want to add these features:
      - browser password grabber
      - self destrucion
      - network mapper
      
and maybe reverse shell function


!IF YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS, I AM WARNING YO. JUST PLEASE, DONT!
Using this logger can cause permanent brain damage. 
Also, please dont use this for malicious purposes
